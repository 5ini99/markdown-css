Markdown.css
============

A peverse way to make your HTML look like markdown, purely via CSS.

Use the `markdown.css` file to  make regular HTML look like plain-text markdown. View [the demo](http://mrcoles.com) to see what Iâ€™m talking about.

The styles are written in `markdown.less`. If you want to hack on this project, you can convert the less files to css with `build.sh` or run the `watch_less.sh` script to have it auto-update when the files change.
